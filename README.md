# funWithColors
my first Django app <br>
My goal is for it to return a solid colored page based on user input. As of 8/27/19, it will return a solid colored page if you type localhost/color/(valid hex code or html color name). Updated to show buttons on the index page for each color in the database. These buttons have background colors of the hex value of the color listed.<br>
The files I've uploaded are just the relevant ones from the app in question, not the entire project, for security purposes.<br>
