# funWithColors
my first Django app <br>
My goal is for it to return a solid colored page based on user input. As of 8/27/19, it will return a solid colored page if you type localhost/color/(valid hex code or html color name). <br>
The files I've uploaded are just the relevant ones from the app in question, not the entire project, for security purposes.<br>
